# W3 - Fun with git

We will play a storytelling game (descriptionÂ [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storytelling_game)) using Git

1.  Divide into groups of MAX 3 people.
    
1.  One person in each group
    
    -   Create repository on GitHub
    -   Add file, e.g.Â `story.txt`Â with the beginning of the story
    
    ```
    Every day John was waking up at 8. AM, taking a shower, having a breakfast and going to work.
    But today, a strange thing happened. John woke up and when he looked out the window, he saw...
    ```
    
    -   Add, Commit, and Push your file on github
1.  Each person in the group
    
    -   Clone repository
    -   Create a branch
    -   Switch to that branch
    -   OpenÂ `story.txt`Â and write 1-2 sentences (Keep it clean ðŸ˜„)
    -   Push your changes to your branch
    -   Merge your changes into main and push to the remote
1.  The whole group
    
    -   Write your next entry and commit it locally before your partners push up their changes
    -   Pull down the new changes from the remote
    -   Resolve Merge conflicts
    -   Rewrite something about your partner's entry

Repeat steps 3-4 until the story is complete or you run out of time, whichever comes first
